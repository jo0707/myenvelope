1
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,300
Look at me

2
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:25,500
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree

3
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,000
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,700
I can't understand

5
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:44,900
I get misty just holding your hand

6
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:50,400
Walk my way 

7
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:58,300
And a thousand violins begin to play

8
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:04,000
Or it might be the sound of your hello

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,300
That music I hear

10
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:17,000
I get misty the moment you're near

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:25,400
Can't you see that you're leading me on?  

12
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:33,800
And it's just what I want you to do

13
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:42,000
Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost? 

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:52,900
That's why I'm following you...

15
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,200
On my own

16
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:04,800
When I wander through this wonderland alone

17
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:10,000
Never knowing my right foot from my left

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,800
My hat from my glove

19
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:26,500
I'm too misty and too much in love

20
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:33,300
Too misty...

21
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:50,000
And too much in love....
